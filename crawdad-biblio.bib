		Unfortunately, the installation and calibration overhead

		13--40 meters (depending upon the characteristics of the

		mechanism. In this paper, we introduce an explicit proactive
		handoff scheme with motion prediction. Since each user has
		patterns of movement, a mobile node predicts its future
		motion and explicitly notifies its old foreign agent which
		subnet it is likely to handoff to. During a handoff, the old
		foreign agent duplicates and forwards packets to the
		predicted subnets. With our scheme, network-layer handoff
		latency can be reduced to the level of link-layer handoff
		latency, and the number of packets lost during handoffs is
		also minimized. With a real network activity trace, we
		demonstrate that this scheme is able to predict motion
		accurately, with only a small overhead in bandwidth
		consumption and computation. },

		average, encounters less than 6\% of the network user
		population within a month, and that encounter and friendship
		relations are highly asymmetric. We establish that number of

		and wireless transceiver capabilities. This paper discusses
		and evaluates ZebraNet's system design decisions in the face
		of a range of real-world constraints.
		
		Impala-ZebraNet's middleware layer - serves as a light-weight
		operating system, but also has been designed to encourage
		application modularity, simplicity, adaptivity, and
		repairability. Impala is now implemented on ZebraNet hardware
		nodes, which include a 16-bit microcontroller, a low-power
		GPS unit, a 900MHz radio, and 4Mbits of non-volatile FLASH
		memory. This paper discusses Impala's operation scheduling
		and event handling model, and explains how system constraints
		and goals led to the interface designs we chose between the
		application, middleware, and firmware layers. We also
		describe Impala's network interface which unifies media
		access control and transport control into an efficient
		network protocol. With the minimum overhead in communication,
		buffering, and processing, it supports a range of message
		models, all inspired by and tailored to ZebraNet's
		application needs. By discussing design tradeoffs in the
		context of a real hardware system and a real sensor network
		application, this paper's design choices and performance
		measurements offer some concrete experiences with software
		systems issues for the mobile sensor design space. More
		generally, we feel that these experiences can guide design
		choices in a range of related systems. },

		exclusively on simulation. The value of the validation is,
		therefore, highly dependent on how realistic the movement
		models used in the simulations are. Since there is a very
		limited number of available real traces in the public domain,
		synthetic models for movement pattern generation must be
		used. However, most widely used models are currently very
		simplistic, their focus being ease of implementation rather
		than soundness of foundation. As a consequence, simulation
		results of protocols are often based on randomly generated
		movement patterns and, therefore, may differ considerably
		from those that can be obtained by deploying the system in
		real scenarios. Movement is strongly affected by the needs of
		humans to socialise or cooperate, in one form or another.
		Fortunately, humans are known to associate in particular ways
		that can be mathematically modelled and that have been
		studied in social sciences for years. In this paper we
		propose a new mobility model founded on social network
		theory. The model allows collections of hosts to be grouped
		together in a way that is based on social relationships among
		the individuals. This grouping is then mapped to a
		topographical space, with movements influenced by the
		strength of social ties that may also change in time. We have
		validated our model with real traces by showing that the
		synthetic mobility traces are a very good approximation of
		human movement patterns.},

		reports on the results of the first extensive empirical
		evaluation of location predictors, using a two-year trace of
		the mobility patterns of over 6,000 users on Dartmouth's

		compared the prediction accuracy of several location
		predictors drawn from two major families of
		domain-independent predictors, namely Markov-based and
		compression-based predictors. We found that low-order Markov
		predictors performed as well or better than the more complex
		and more space-consuming compression-based predictors.
		Predictors of both families fail to make a prediction when
		the recent context has not been previously seen. To overcome
		this drawback, we added a simple fallback feature to each
		predictor and found that it significantly enhanced its
		accuracy in exchange for modest effort. Thus the Order-2
		Markov predictor with fallback was the best predictor we
		studied, obtaining a median accuracy of about 72\% for users
		with long trace lengths. We also investigated a
		simplification of the Markov predictors, where the prediction
		is based not on the most frequently seen context in the past,
		but the most recent, resulting in significant space and
		computational savings. We found that Markov predictors with
		this recency semantics can rival the accuracy of standard
		Markov predictors in some cases. Finally, we considered
		several seemingly obvious enhancements, such as smarter
		tie-breaking and aging of context information, and discovered
		that they had little effect on accuracy. The paper ends with
		a discussion and suggestions for further work. },

		wireless networks can better serve their clients by
		anticipating client mobility. As a result, many location
		predictors have been proposed in the literature, though few
		have been evaluated with empirical evidence. This paper
		reports on the results of the first extensive empirical
		evaluation of location predictors, using a two-year trace of
		the mobility patterns of over 6,000 users on Dartmouth's
		campus-wide Wi-Fi wireless network. We implemented and
		compared the prediction accuracy of several location
		predictors drawn from four major families of
		domain-independent predictors, namely Markov-based,
		compression-based, PPM, and SPM predictors. We found that
		low-order Markov predictors performed as well or better than
		the more complex and more space-consuming compression-based
		predictors. Predictors of both families fail to make a
		prediction when the recent context has not been previously
		seen. To overcome this drawback, we added a simple fallback
		feature to each predictor and found that it significantly
		enhanced its accuracy in exchange for modest effort. Thus the
		Order-2 Markov predictor with fallback was the best predictor
		we studied, obtaining a median accuracy of about 72\% for
		users with long trace lengths. We also investigated a
		simplification of the Markov predictors, where the prediction
		is based not on the most frequently seen context in the past,
		but the most recent, resulting in significant space and
		computational savings. We found that Markov predictors with
		this recency semantics can rival the accuracy of standard
		Markov predictors in some cases. Finally, we considered
		several seemingly obvious enhancements, such as smarter
		tie-breaking and aging of context information, and discovered
		that they had little effect on accuracy. The paper ends with
		a discussion and suggestions for further work.},

		prediction holds a key value that is widely acknowledged in
		the literature. \par Although other researchers have explored
		mobility prediction in hypothetical scenarios, evaluating
		their predictors analytically or with synthetic data, few
		studies have been able to evaluate their predictors with real

		more than 500 access points and 6,000 users. Extending our
		earlier work that focuses on predicting the next-visited
		access point (i.e., location), in this work we explore the
		predictability of the time of user mobility. Indeed, our
		contributions are two-fold. First, we evaluate a series of
		predictors that reflect possible dependencies across time and
		space while benefiting from either individual or group
		mobility behaviors. Second, as a case study we examine voice
		applications and the use of handoff prediction for advance
		bandwidth reservation. Using application-specific performance
		metrics such as call drop and call block rates, we provide a
		complete picture on the gains of prediction. \par Our results
		indicate that it is difficult to predict handoff time
		accurately, when applied to real campus WLAN data. However,
		the findings of our case study also suggest that the
		application performance can be improved significantly even
		with predictors that are only moderately accurate. The gains
		depend on the applications' ability to use predictions and
		tolerate inaccurate predictions. In the case study, we
		combine the real mobility data with synthesized traffic data.
		The results show that intelligent prediction can lead to
		significant reductions in the rate at which active calls are
		dropped due to handoffs with marginal increments in the rate
		at which new calls are blocked.},

		opportunities to competing nodes when all nodes experience

		Because of varying indoor channel conditions, the 802.11

		the trade-off between data rate and bit error rate. This
		leads to considerable rate diversity, particularly when the

  abstract    =	{ The enormous potential for wireless sensor networks to make
		a positive impact on our society has spawned a great deal of
		research on the topic, and this research is now producing
		environment-ready systems. Current technology limits coupled
		with widely-varying application requirements lead to a
		diversity of hardware platforms for diÂ®erent portions of the
		design space. In addition, the unique energy and reliability
		constraints of a system that must function for months at a
		time without human intervention mean that demands on sensor
		network hardware are different from the demands on standard
		integrated circuits. This paper describes our experiences
		designing sensor nodes and low level software to control them.
		
		In the ZebraNet system we use GPS technology to record
		fine-grained position data in order to track long term animal
		migrations. The ZebraNet hardware is composed of a 16-bit TI
		microcontroller, 4 Mbits of off-chip flash memory, a 900 MHz
		radio, and a low-power GPS chip. In this paper, we discuss
		our techniques for devising efficient power supplies for
		sensor networks, methods of managing the energy consumption
		of the nodes, and methods of managing the peripheral devices
		including the radio, flash, and sensors. We conclude by
		evaluating the design of the ZebraNet nodes and discussing
		how it can be improved. Our lessons learned in developing
		this hardware can be useful both in designing future sensor
		nodes and in using them in real systems. },
